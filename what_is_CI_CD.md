## What is CI/CD?

- Stands for Continuous Integration / Coninuous Delivery/Deployment
- Introduces automation into the stages of development

## Why use CI/CD?

- Ongoing automation and monitoring during the life cycle of application delivery from integration and testing to delivery and deployment
- Enables continuous delivery
- Increases profitability of code in production
- CI/CD pipelines enable shorter time to market for new products and features
- Automation of builds and tests allows developers to make smaller changes and deploy them easily

## What is Jenkins?

- Jenkins is an open source (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool written in the Java programming language. 
- It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.
- The code that defines a pipeline is written inside a text file, known as the Jenkinsfile.

## Stages of Jenkins

- Build, Test, Deploy

## What alternatives are there to Jenkins?

- TeamCity
- AWS CodePipeline
- Bamboo
- CircleCI
- Gitlab CI
- Travis CI

## Why use Jenkins?

### Advantages:

- Jenkins is open-source, providing a more economical solution to teams on a tight budget.
- It has 1800+ plugins making Jenkins more diverse, supporting more languages, and also aiding Jenkins users in designing more variegated pipelines.
- It can be used with several popular OS such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- It is the oldest open-source automation server and thus has extensive documentation and community resources. This makes it easier to use since guides are available for all functions of Jenkins.
- It is self-hosted, giving the user greater control over the CI/CD pipeline. This allows for more customized and tailor-made workflows to be developed.
- It is over a decade old and has gained a reputation for being highly reliable.
- Jenkins is based on Java, making it a very robust framework.
### Disadvantages

- Jenkins requires a dedicated team/person who is highly specialized and has extensive experience in using it.
- It is notorious for being difficult to set up and requiring a highly hands-on, manual approach to building pipelines.
- Although Jenkins has a plethora of plug-ins available, there is often little upkeep performed for these plugins. Additionally, there is no way to confirm that the plug-in that a team needs to use will be maintained.
- The user interface is not very easily understandable and requires some time to get used to.
- It relies on antiquated Java technologies and is relatively brittle.
- Errors are difficult to resolve.
- If multiple teams use Jenkins simultaneously for a particular project, these servers can become difficult to track and manage.
- It is a hassle to update.
